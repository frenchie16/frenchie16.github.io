I am working on some [RUSA permanent routes](https://rusa.org/pages/permanents).
When they have been submitted to and approved by RUSA, this page will be updated.

# Three Bridges of the Bay

RUSA permanent #[3918](https://rusa.org/cgi-bin/permview_GF.pl?permid=3918)

I came up with the idea for this route when I heard that the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge bike lane would soon open.
The concept is inspired by the [Seven Bridges of Königsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_Königsberg), a famous problem in mathematics.
This route crosses every bridge across the San Francisco Bay on which bicycles are permitted.

## Notes

I will accept EPP (electronic proof of passage).
See the RUSA [rules for permanent riders](https://rusa.org/pages/permRiderRules) for details.

The Richmond-San Rafael bridge bike path will reportedly open on November 16, 2019.
As far as I know at the time of writing, it will be open 24 hours a day for a trial period of four years.
Please check that it is still open when planning a ride!

The route is reversible (you can opt to ride it in either direction).
Also, per the RUSA rules, you may arrange to start at any control.
However, you are responsible for ensuring that all trails will be open at the time when you will reach them.
In particular, the [Crystal Springs trails](https://parks.smcgov.org/crystal-springs-trail-regulations) are open from sunrise to sunset, and the [Bay Bridge trail](https://www.baybridgeinfo.org/path) is open from 06:00 to 21:00 (and businesses on Treasure Island have limited hours).
The other bridges have 24-hour access for cyclists.
